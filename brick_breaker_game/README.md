## Game Overview

Brick Breaker is a simple yet addictive game where the player's objective is to destroy all the bricks in each level using a ball and a paddle. The game progresses through three different levels, each with increasing difficulty. Players can save their progress, load previously saved games, and compete for high scores on the leaderboard.

## Core Mechanics

### Paddle Movement

- **Movement**: The paddle is controlled by the player and can move horizontally along the bottom of the screen. The default keybindings are:
  - **Left Arrow**: Move the paddle to the left.
  - **Right Arrow**: Move the paddle to the right.
  
- **Boundary**: The paddle cannot move beyond the edges of the screen, ensuring that it remains within the game area.

### Ball Physics

- **Launch**: The ball is launched from the paddle at the beginning of the game or after losing a life.
- **Bouncing**: The ball bounces off the walls, ceiling, and paddle. It also bounces off bricks, which may be destroyed upon impact.
- **Gravity**: There is no gravity in the game, so the ball maintains its speed unless it collides with objects, which might alter its trajectory.

### Power Ups

- **Increase Ball Speed**: Makes the ball move faster.
- **Decrease Ball Speed**: Makes the ball move slower
- **Increase paddle speed**: Makes the paddle move faster
- **Decrease paddle speed**: Makes the paddle move slower.
- **Increase paddle speed**: Makes the paddle move faster
- **Increase paddle size**: Makes the paddle size increase.
- **Decrease paddle speed**: Makes the paddle size decrease.
- **Score boost**: Adds score to the player that allows the player to rank higher in the leaderboard



### Levels

The game features three different levels, each with a unique layout of bricks and increasing difficulty:

1. **Level 1 - France**: An introductory level with a simple arrangement of standard bricks.
2. **Level 2 - England**: A more challenging level that introduces more complex brick patterns.
3. **Level 3 - Greece**: The final and most difficult level.

## Game Features

### Save and Load

- **Save Game**: Players can save their current progress at any point during the game. This saves the current level, score, and remaining lives.
- **Load Game**: Players can load a previously saved game, allowing them to continue from where they left off. Only one save file is supported at a time.

### Leaderboard

- The leaderboard records the top 10 highest scores achieved by players.
